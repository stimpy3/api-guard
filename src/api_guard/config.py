"""Configuration model for `api-guard.yaml`.

The config is the whole reason this tool is reusable: a project tells api-guard
where its spec lives and how to regenerate it, and api-guard never needs to
know whether that project is FastAPI, Spring Boot or hand-written YAML.

Only `spec` is required. Omitting a section disables the check that depends on
it, so a team with a hand-maintained spec still gets breaking-change detection
without being forced to invent a `generate_cmd`.
