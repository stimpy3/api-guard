"""Check 3: does the running API still honour its spec?

Checks 1 and 2 only ever read files. This one sends real requests at a real
server, which is why it catches the failure the other two structurally cannot:
the spec is unchanged, so oasdiff sees nothing to compare, but the
implementation has drifted away from it — a handler now returns null for a
non-nullable field, or a status code the spec never mentions.

Schemathesis generates the requests from the spec itself, so no test cases have
to be written or maintained by hand. That is the whole appeal: the tests come
from the contract, so they cannot fall out of step with it.
